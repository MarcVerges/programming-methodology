# Programming-methodology

**Advanced programming practices using C++ including dynamic memory, object-oriented programming, and complexity analysis.**

---

This repository includes coursework and programming exercises from the *Programming Methodology* course.  
It builds upon foundational skills and explores more advanced topics such as dynamic memory management, pointers, linked structures, class design, and algorithmic complexity.  
Special topics include stacks, queues, inheritance, operator overloading, recursive algorithms, and data structure efficiency.  
The materials reflect my transition from procedural programming to a more object-oriented and abstracted approach.  
Comments and documentation accompany the code to facilitate understanding and review.  
This repository aims to reflect both theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.
